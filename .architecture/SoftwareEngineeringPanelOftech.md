# Software Engineering Panel of Tech

Simon Martyr was the initiator of this panel. His feedback on his appraisal raised the fair point that there must be 
more input, from our more senior developers, on tactical and strategic technology decisions we make for the Software 
Engineering domain. This document highlights points we have talked about at our initial meeting, and it is intended 
that we use this document as a living governance guide.

## Panel Information

|                 |                                                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Members         | Andrew Hagens, Kevin Pennekamp, Simon Martyr, Thomas Poiesz |
| Meeting Cadence | Once a month                                                |
| Goal            | Input for tactical and strategic technology decisions       |

## Goal 
the goal of this panel is to function as input into the tech radar, with which we want to better communicate our 
technology decisions. The tech radar is also a good vehicle for tactical and strategic planning. This process will 
aid Finaps in solidifying its technology choices and to guide developers to make good decisions regarding 
technology choice. 

A secondary function of this panel is to have a place withing the software engineering domain, where we share 
knowledge about certain topics, and/or comparison. We can even record comparative pieces, and show where 
each mentioned technology stand in the radar. This benefits us in that we not only have what you must choose, but why.

## Output

Content for tactical and strategic decision-making is the expected output here. It must come in the form of Radar 
blips and longer form literature.
