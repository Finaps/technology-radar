## 1. Introduction

This document describes in detail the concept, purpose, reqruirements and general information of the Finaps Technology Radar.

### 1.1 Product scope

Goal:
- To track and document relevant technologies/techiques in a way that reflects desitions made around them based on previous experience and their status in the current technology landscape of Finaps.

Benefits:
- Provides a platform to comunicate lessons learned, good practices and experiences.
- Reflects desitions made about Finaps' technology landscape.
- Provides a better insight of different interesting and current technologies in the context of Finaps.

Objectives:
- To display Finaps' current technology context and its evolution through time.
- To serve as a guide to Finaps engineers when selecting techniologies for new projects.
- To serve as a document on which to make technology-based desitions and investments.


### 1.2 Product value

For Finaps engineers:
- Provides aid when selecting a technology for a project based on previous experience and the opinions of the Finaps Panel of Tech.
- Provides a platfrom where knowladege about specific technologies can be shared.

For Finaps management:
- Provides a document on which stategical desitions regarding technology are presented.
- Gives a visual panorama view of the current state of interesting and current technogies in coparison to Finaps' use and experience with them.
- Provides help and grounds to make business desitions related to technology used.


### 1.3 Intended audience

Finaps management, Software Engineering Panel of Tech members, and all Finaps engineers.

### 1.4 Intended use

This product is intented to work as the updated output of the Sofware Engineering Panel of Tech meetings and to be used as a tool and reference by all Finaps engineers. It is also intented to aid the strategical and tactical desition-making by Finaps management.

### 1.5 General description

The Technology Radar is a tool that graphically shows the input made by the Software Engineering Panel of Tech in regards of Finaps' technology landscape. It will place individual radar blips into four different quadrants (languages & frameworks, infrastructure, datastores, and data management) and four different levels of adoption (Adopt, Trial, Assess and Hold). Each radar blip will contain additional information about itself, and can contain references to external literature and documentation, as well as its evolution through the radar. A single blip will be a part of a single quadrant and have a single level of adoption determined by the Software Engineering Panel of Tech.

Levels of adoption:
- **Adopt**: Blips that are prooven to work and trusted by the team to serve our purpose. Technologies and techniqies that are suggested to seriously consider. Mature for use.
- **Trial**: Blips that have worked in the past and are known to work well for us but are not entirely proven. Not quite ready to be adopted but we have knowledge and experience with them that can be shared.
- **Asses**: Blips that are showing potential and we think are worth looking into. 
- **Hold**: Blips that are fount not to be worth investing our time and effort. Technologies that are not recommended to work with even though they might be accepted in an industry level.

Radar quadrants:
- **Languages & frameworks**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Datastores**
- **Data management**
