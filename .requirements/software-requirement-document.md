## 2. Functional Requirements

Design requirements:
- The tool must show all blips in the radar
- The tool must allow adding new blips the radar
- The tool must allow editing blips from the radar
- The tool must allow removing blips from the radar
- The tool must allow updating a blip's position on the radar (level of adoption and/or quadrant)
- The tool must show particular information of each individual blip
- The tool must show a blip's changes through the radar over time
- The tool must save a blip's progress through time and its changes

Graphic requirements:
- The tool must show clearly the position of each blip on the radar
- The tool must show clearly the boudries between each quadrant and each level of adoption
- The tool must be color coded to easely recognize blips that are and are not gropued in the same categories
- The tool could show how close or far a blip is to its neighboring levels of adoption. *E.G. If a blip is closer to the "Asses" level of adoption than other blip, it acctually means that the technology is closer to being in the "Asses" level than the other blip.*

Product constraints:
- The tool should not be taken as an in-depth guide of the technologies presented, but as a reference point to make decisions.
- The tool should not be taken as a market analysis
