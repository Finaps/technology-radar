## 2. Functional Requirements

Design requirements:
- The tool must allow Fianps engineers to nevegate to the radar page and read its contents
- The tool must show all blips in the radar
- The tool must show particular information of each individual blip
- The tool must show a blip's changes through the radar over time
- The tool must save a blip's progress through time and its changes
- The tool must allow Finaps engieneers to request changes to the radar (such as adding a new blip, or providing insight for the modification of the position of a current blip on the radar), giving the blip to change, the changes, and a reason for them
- The tool must allow a user to login to the "back office"
- The tool must allow adding new blips the radar (Back office)
- The tool must allow editing blips from the radar (Back office)
- The tool must allow removing blips from the radar (Back office)
- The tool must allow updating a blip's position on the radar (level of adoption and/or quadrant) (Back office)
- The tool must allow members of the Software Engineering Panel of Tech to review the change requests sent by engineers
- The tool must allow members of the Softare Engineering Panel of Tech to reject or accept request change requests to the radar

Graphic requirements:
- The tool must show clearly the position of each blip on the radar
- The tool must show clearly the boundaries between each quadrant and each level of adoption
- The tool must be color coded to easily recognize blips that are and are not grouped in the same categories
- The tool could show how close or far a blip is to its neighboring levels of adoption. *E.G. If a blip is closer to the "Asses" level of adoption than other blip, it actually means that the technology is closer to being in the "Asses" level than the other blip.*

Product constraints:
- The tool should not be taken as an in-depth guide of the technologies presented, but as a reference point to make decisions.
- The tool should not be taken as a market analysis√ü
- The back office functionality of the tool must only be accesible by members of the Software Engineering Panel of Tech
